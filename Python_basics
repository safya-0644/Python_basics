Exercise: 1

What is Syntax? Give some python syntax examples.
Python syntax is the set of rules that define how to write and interpret Python programs. It's designed to be easy to read and understand, and is considered "executable pseudocode"

Define Variables in programming
A named container that holds data values and is used to keep track of values as code runs.

What are the data types are available in python. Give a brief note about each
data types
Numeric – int, float, complex
Sequence Type – string, list, tuple
Mapping Type – dict
Boolean – bool
Set Type – set, frozenset
Binary Types – bytes, bytearray, memoryview

Print a value from variable
Let’s take a variable name as ‘a’ and assign the value to it as 10
=> a=10
=> print(a) #printing the value stored in that variable ‘a’
=> Output : 10

Concatenation of 3 strings from variable
Let’s take 3 variables named as ‘a’,’b’,’c’
=> a=’Hello’
=> b=”World’
=> c=’!’
=>print(a+b+c) #Concatenating the 3 variables
=> Output : HelloWorld!

Build calculator with 2 variables
=> a=12
=> b=10
=> print(‘Add: ’,a+b)
=> print(‘Sub: ’,a-b)
=>print(‘Multiple: ’a*b)
=> Output: 22 2 120
Exercise: 2
String manipulation

“Python” - what is the index value of letter “t”?
=> n= ‘Python’
=> print(n.index(‘t’))
=> Output: 2

“Welcome‘ - Extract the 4th value from the given string.
=> n= ‘Welcome’
=> print(n[4])
=> Output: o

Calculate the length of this word “Python”.
=> n= ‘Python’
=> print(len(n))
=> Output: 6

“I’m doing great‘ -. Write a python code to convert this to upper case.
=> n= “I’m doing great”
=> print(n.upper())
=> Output: I’M DOING GREAT

Fill in the blanks - “_____ is my country” and “____ is learning ____”
=> a='India'
=> b='She'
=> c='Python'
=> print(f'{a} is my country and {b} is learning {c}')
=> Output: India is my country and She is learning Python

Check “learn” is exist in the given string - “I’m learning python”
=> n=“I’m learning python”
=> print(‘learn’ in n)
=> Output: False

Check “Python” is not present in the given string “i’m learning NodeJs”
=> n=“i’m learning NodeJs”
=> print(‘Python’ not in n)
=> Output: True

Exercise: 3
IF & FOR Loops

Get the character at position 1 of a string
=> n= ‘Programming Language’
=> print(n[1])
=> Output: r

Substring. Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included)
=> n= ‘Programming Language’
=> print(n[2:5])
=> Output: rog

Remove whitespace from the beginning or at the end of a string
=> n= ‘ Programming Language ’
=> print(n.strip())
=> Output: Programming Language

Return the length of a string
=> n= ‘Programming Language’
=> print(len(n))
=> Output: 22

Convert a string to uppercase, lower case.
=> n= ‘Programming Language’
=> print(n.upper())
=> print(n.lower())
=> Output: PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE  programming language

Replace a string with another string (Welcome Raja - Replace Raja with Roja)
=> n= ‘Welcome Raja’
=> print(n.replace(‘Raja’ , ‘Roja’))
=> Output: Welcome Roja

Split a string into different (‘hello,world’)
=> n= ‘Programming Language ’
=> print(n.split())
=> Output: [‘Programming’ , ‘Language’]


Python Operators - Addition and Subtraction and mul and division and modulus
=> a=12
=> b=10
=> print (a+b)
=> print (a-b)
=> print (a*b)
=> print (a/b)
=> Output: 22 2 120 1.2
