# Program to calculate the power of a number

# Taking the base and exponent as input from the user
b = int(input('Enter the base value: '))  # The base value
e = int(input('Enter the exponent value: '))  # The exponent value

# Printing the result of base raised to the power of exponent
print(f'{b} raised to the power of {e}:', b**e)
